# Contributing

All constructive contributions are welcome!

## Workflow

Please fork, create a branch, commit your work in atomic elements, and open a PR to contribute. I generally squash and merge or rebase and merge from the PR, so no need to squash it ahead of time if you don't want to.

## Environment setup

Each environment should have its own directory that includes everything you need to start locally unless you cannot demonstrate the common issue with minikube or another local system. Ensure you include a README in each directory with directions on how to start the environment locally.

## Naming

Avoid naming the directory or writing the README in such a way as to give away the problem people are solving for! Also, do not group environments together in sections like _networking_ or _application_. We don't get hints in the real world, so until someone convinces me otherwise, I'd like to keep away from that hinting as much as possible.

## Final Notes

Note that you shouldn't submit fixes to make an environment work properly. That's not the point ;)

Have fun!
